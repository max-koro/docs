## New features

📥 You can now [export account data](/topics/accounts/overview/guide-export) in `.csv` format from your Dashboard or with the API by calling the `exportAccountData` mutation.

## Improvements

🪪 `Auto` [identification](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/authentication/guide-get-token-user/#url-parameters-optional) is now smoother. To automatically skip the identification process for eligible users on projects configured to bypass it, add the `accountMembershipId` to the authorization URL when inviting account members. 

🤏 To help protect you and the merchant from fraud, merchant payments may now be subject to a `paymentAmountLimit`. 
This applies to each individual payment when it’s initiated. Based on various risk factors, we may set this [limit](https://docs.swan.io/developers/using-api/webhooks/#events-funding) when reviewing the merchant payment method, or at a later stage. 
The limit is available in the `merchantPaymentMethod` type in the API, for [Card](/topics/merchants/online/cards/#payment-limit), [SEPA Direct Debit](/topics/merchants/online/sdd/#payment-limit) (Core and B2B), and [French check](/topics/merchants/online/checks/#payment-limit) payments. 
Setting a limit will trigger a `MerchantPaymentMethod.Updated` webhook.
