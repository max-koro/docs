## New features

ðŸ“¥ You can now [export card data](/topics/cards/overview/guide-export/) in `.csv` format from your Dashboard or with the API by calling the `exportCardData` mutation.

ðŸ”” You can now activate two [new text message notifications](/topics/projects/#notifications-text-message) for rejected card payments due to an **incorrect PIN** or an **invalid card expiration date**. 
Activate them from your **Dashboard** > **Settings**Â >Â **Notifications**.

ðŸ’Œ A new white-labeled [email notification](/topics/projects/#notifications-email) for card expiration is now available! 
Activate it from your **Dashboard** > **Settings**Â >Â **Notifications**.

## Update

ðŸ”´ To provide more detailed feedback on input errors, errors in the `addCards` inputs, especially the [physical card delivery address](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/print-physical-card-input/) and [spending limit](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/spending-limit/), will now return a `ValidationRejection` instead of an error.
