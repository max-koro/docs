## New features

💳 You can now disable the ability for users to update card settings in Swan's Web Banking from your **Dashboard** > **Web banking** settings tab. 
When disabled, users with the `CanUpdateCards` permission can only update their card limits through your product, not Web Banking.

## Improvements

🧭 We've released several updates to improve your **Dashboard**:
- We've improved the search on your Dashboard to return more accurate results. 
Results now narrow automatically as your input becomes more detailed.
This update is available on the Account Holders, Onboarding, Account, Account Memberships, and Capital Deposits pages.
- **Filters** have a new look across all Dashboard pages to help you find data more efficiently.
Based on user feedback, we added **quick filters** for all **verification statuses** on the Account Holders page. 
We **removed the Verifications page** because the new filters provide the same information in a more accessible way.

🔍 We've added [new filters](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/transactions-filters-input/) to make it easier to search for [transaction information](/topics/payments/overview/guide-get-transaction-info/) by **amount** and **execution date**:

- **Amount** filters: we added `isAboveAmount` and `isBelowAmount`. We also updated the `amount` filter to return an exact match.
These filters are now cumulative and will replace the current `amount` field in the transactions search filter (*see upcoming breaking change*).
- **Execution date** filters: we added `isAfterExecutionDate` and `isBeforeExecutionDate`.

✍️ The `requestMerchantPaymentMethods` mutation now validates your [SEPA Creditor Identifier (SCI)](/topics/merchants/online/sdd/#sci) when you request [SEPA Direct Debit](/topics/merchants/online/sdd/guide-request/).
If the SCI is invalid, the mutation will reject it, helping you avoid blocked transactions in the future.

📝 You can now retrieve all transactions initiated by a standing order using the `standingOrder.transactions` [query](https://api-reference.swan.io/objects/standing-order/#standingordertransactionstransactionconnection-).

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking changes
Starting **June 19**:
👥 The `amount` field will be removed from the transactions `search` filter.
Please use the `amount` filters to refine your search.
💸 The `beneficiaryId` and `isMyOwnIban` input fields will be removed from the `initiateCreditTransfers` mutation.
The `isMyOwnIban` field will become optional.

🛑 A new rejection type, `ValidationRejection`, will be used to validate an input in the `initiateCreditTransfers` mutation.

🚫 Calls to `scheduleStandingOrder` with an invalid `reference` will be rejected. 
See the [API reference](https://api-reference.swan.io/inputs/schedule-standing-order-input#schedulestandingorderinputreferencestring-) for the regex pattern.
