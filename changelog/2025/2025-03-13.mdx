## New feature

📱 Users can now change the [phone number](/topics/users/#phone-numbers) associated with their Swan account securely and independently.
Tap *New phone number? Update it* at the beginning of any login or consent flow and follow the prompts.

## Update

⭐️ Effective **March 13**, all new business debit cards are issued with a new Banking Identification Number (BIN).
Card numbers with the new BIN start with **`543946`** instead of the current `547395`.
The BIN for existing cards will be updated automatically when the cards are [renewed](/topics/cards/physical/#renew-statuses).

## API updates

### Upcoming breaking change

📓 Effective **May 1st**, providing [`gender`](https://api-reference.swan.io/enums/gender/) for [Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBO)](/topics/onboarding/company/#country-reqs-ubo) is mandatory due to Swan’s reporting obligations. 
This field includes more granular options than the `title` field, set to be deprecated on May 1st.
